#The vertex set of the modular product of G and H is the cartesian product V(G) Ã—  V(H). Any two vertices (u, v) and (u' , v' ) are adjacent in the modular product of G and H if and only if either

#    u is adjacent with u' and v is adjacent with v' , or
#    u is not adjacent with u' and v is not adjacent with v' .
